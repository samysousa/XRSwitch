# XRSwitch
OpenXR Runtime Switcher

A tool to select OpenXR runtime to use.
Allowing for more control and the ability to switch Runtime without going into each individual tool
to "Mark as default".

Switching while running allows different apps to run trough different runtimes and "possibly" different headsets.
